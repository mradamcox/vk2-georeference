The Virtual Map Forum 2.0 allows the searching and viewing of historic and georeferenced maps and offers further capabilities for the georeferencing of historic maps. The `vk2-georeference` is therefor the backend systems, which allows the production of temporary georeference results by offering a web service and the production of persistence georeference results by running a daemon in background. Client code which works with the `vk2-georeference` web service could be found in the [vk2-extension](https://github.com/slub/vk2-extension) project.
